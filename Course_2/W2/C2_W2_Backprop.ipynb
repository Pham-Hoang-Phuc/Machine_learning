    "# Optional Lab: Back propagation using a computation graph\n",
    "Working through this lab will give you insight into a key algorithm used by most machine learning frameworks. Gradient descent requires the derivative of the cost with respect to each parameter in the network.  Neural networks can have millions or even billions of parameters. The *back propagation* algorithm is used to compute those derivatives. *Computation graphs* are used to simplify the operation. Let's dig into this below."
