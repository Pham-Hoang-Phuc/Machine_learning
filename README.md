## General Introduction

This repository serves as a personal log and tracker for my learning progress, containing programming assignments and notes from the renowned **Machine Learning** course on Coursera, taught by **Professor Andrew Ng** (Stanford University).

The goal of this repository is to consolidate the acquired knowledge and provide a readily available reference for the assignment solutions (written in Python/Jupyter Notebook).


## Repository Structure

The assignments are organized by the course for easy navigation:

| Directory | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Course_1` | Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification | 
| `Course_2` | Advanced Learning Algorithms |


*(Note: This repository is structured to evolve alongside the curriculum. New course modules will be added sequentially as I progress through the complete specialization.)*

## Technology Used

* **Language**: Python 3.12.7
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

## How to Use

1.  **Clone** the Repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Machine_learning.git
    ```

2.  **Install** the necessary libraries (if a `requirements.txt` file is present):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Open the `.ipynb` files inside the corresponding week's folder to view the detailed assignments and solutions.


## Contribution

Although this is a personal repository, I welcome any suggestions or discussions regarding code and algorithm optimization.
